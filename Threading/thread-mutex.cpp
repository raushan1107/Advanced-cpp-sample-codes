        // if multiple threads try to increment it simultaneously without synchronization,
        // it can lead to race conditions and inconsistent results.
        // To prevent this, we use a mutex to ensure that only one thread can access the critical
        // section at a time.

// Use case:
// Mutexes are commonly used in multi-threaded applications to protect shared resources
// from concurrent access, ensuring data integrity and preventing race conditions
// Examples include:
// 1. Database access: When multiple threads need to read/write to a database,
//    a mutex can ensure that only one thread accesses the database at a time.
// 2. File operations: When multiple threads need to read/write to a file,
//    a mutex can prevent simultaneous access that could corrupt the file.
// 3. Shared data structures: When multiple threads need to modify shared data structures
//    like linked lists, hash tables, etc., a mutex can ensure that only one thread
//    modifies the structure at a time, preventing inconsistencies.
