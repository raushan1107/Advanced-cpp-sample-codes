// What is move semantics in C++?
// Move semantics is a feature in C++11 and later that allows the resources of temporary objects to be 'moved' rather than copied.
// This is particularly useful for optimizing performance when dealing with large objects or resources like dynamic memory,
// file handles, or network connections. Move semantics is implemented using rvalue references and the std::move function.
// By using move semantics, we can avoid unnecessary deep copies of objects, leading to more efficient code.
// Move semantics is often used in conjunction with resource management classes, such as smart pointers,
// to ensure that resources are transferred correctly without duplication.

#include <iostream>
#include<vector>

vector<int> createLargeVector() {
    vector<int> temp(10000000,11); // Large vector with 10 million elements initialized to 11
    cout << "Creating large vector from pre-defined function..." << endl;
    return temp; // Return by value, will invoke move semantics
}

// when we use & and && in function parameters?
// In C++, & is used to denote lvalue references, which refer to named objects that have a persistent state.
// && is used to denote rvalue references, which refer to temporary objects that are about to be destroyed.
// Lvalue references allow functions to modify the original object passed to them, while rvalue references enable move semantics,
// allowing resources to be transferred from temporary objects without making copies.

// Overloaded function to handle lvalue references
void processVector(vector<int>& vec) {
    cout << "Processing lvalue vector of size: " << vec.size() << endl;
    // Further processing can be done here
}

// Overloaded function to handle rvalue references
void processVector(vector<int>&& vec) {
    cout << "Processing rvalue vector of size: " << vec.size() << endl;
    // Further processing can be done here
}

int main() {

    vector<int> a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    processVector(a); // Calls lvalue overload
    processVector(vector<int>{6, 7, 8, 9, 10}); // Calls rvalue overload

    cout << "Before move, size of a: " << a.size() << endl;
    vector<int> b = move(a); // Move constructor
    cout << "Size of a after move: " << a.size() << endl;
    cout << "Size of b after move: " << b.size() << endl;

    cout << "Demonstrating Move Semantics in C++" << endl;

    // Using move semantics to avoid unnecessary copies but how it works internally?
    // When we return temp from createLargeVector, instead of copying the entire vector,
    // the move constructor is invoked, transferring ownership of the resources from temp to the new vector.
    // This leaves temp in a valid but unspecified state, and the new vector now owns the resources.
    // But can we show that move constructor is invoked?
    // Yes, we can add print statements in the createLargeVector function to indicate when the vector is created and returned.
    // However, since std::vector already has move semantics implemented, we won't see explicit print statements for the move constructor.
    vector<int> largeVector = createLargeVector(); // Move constructor is invoked here
    cout << "Size of largeVector: " << largeVector.size() << endl;
    largeVector.push_back(42); // Modify the vector to show it's usable
    cout << "New Size of largeVector: " << largeVector.size() << endl;
    cout << "First element of largeVector: " << largeVector[0] << endl;

    cout << "size of Vector after move: " << createLargeVector().size() << endl;
    cout << "First element of Vector after move: " << createLargeVector()[0] << endl;


    // Print temp vector we have inside createLargeVector function, will it be accessible here?
    // No, temp is a local variable inside createLargeVector and goes out of scope when the function ends. But how to testify it is moved?
    // We can add print statements in createLargeVector to show when the vector is created and moved.
    // Let's create another vector to see the move in action: 
    // So here we are calling createLargeVector again to create another vector.
    // It will invoke the move constructor again.
    // This demonstrates that the resources are being moved rather than copied.
    // We can add print statements in createLargeVector to show when the vector is created and moved.
    // but how? 
    // We can add a print statement before returning the vector in createLargeVector function.
    

    // Overall, move semantics helps optimize performance by eliminating unnecessary copies,
    // especially for large objects, leading to more efficient resource management in C++.
    // Let's see rvalue reference in action:
    vector<int> vec1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    vector<int> vec2 = move(vec1); // vec1 is now in a valid but unspecified state
    cout << "Size of vec1 after move: " << vec1.size() << endl; // vec1 size is now 0
    cout << "Size of vec2 after move: " << vec2.size() << endl; // vec2 size is 5

    // demostrating rvalue and lvalue:
    int x = 10; // x is an lvalue
    int&& rvalueRef = 20; // 20 is an rvalue
    // is this like dynamic variable?
    // No, rvalue references are not like dynamic variables. They are a type of reference that can bind to temporary objects (rvalues).
    // They allow us to implement move semantics by enabling the transfer of resources from temporary objects.
    // rvalue references are typically used in move constructors and move assignment operators to optimize resource management
    // for temporary objects.

    cout << "Lvalue x: " << x << endl;
    cout << "Rvalue reference rvalueRef: " << rvalueRef << endl;
    rvalueRef = 30; // Modify the rvalue reference
    cout << "New Rvalue reference rvalueRef: " << rvalueRef << endl;
    cout << "Elements in vec2 after move from vec1:" << endl;
    for(int n:vec2){
        cout << n << " ";
    }

    cout << "--------------" << endl;
    // Optional: simulate moved-from state check (not directly possible for returned local)
    // But we can demonstrate with an explicit move
    vector<int> original(1000000, 99);
    cout << "Original size before move = " << original.size() << endl;
 
    vector<int> movedTo = std::move(original);
