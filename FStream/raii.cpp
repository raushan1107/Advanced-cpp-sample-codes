// One such case is when you are dealing with temporary files or when you want to ensure
// that a file is closed at a specific point in your code before the object goes out of scope.
// or, when you want to handle errors during file operations
// and need to close the file immediately after an error is detected.
// or, when working with c style file handling using FILE* pointers
// where you need to explicitly call fclose() to release the resource.
