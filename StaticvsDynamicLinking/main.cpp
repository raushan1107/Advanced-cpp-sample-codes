// Steps to keep in mind:
// 1. Create header file (rrmathlib.h) with function declarations.
// 2. Create source file (rrmathlib.cpp) with function definitions.
// 3. Compile rrmathlib.cpp to create a static library (e.g., librrmathlib.a) or dynamic library (e.g., rrmathlib.dll or librrmathlib.so).
// 4. In main.cpp, include the header file and link against the library during compilation
//   (e.g., g++ main.cpp -L. -lrrmathlib -o main). or ( g++ main.cpp rrmathlib.cpp -o main for static linking).
// 5. Run the executable to see the results.
// What is the difference between static and dynamic linking?
// - Static Linking: In static linking, all the library code used by the program is copied
//   into the final executable at compile time. This results in a larger executable size
//   but allows the program to run independently of external libraries.
// - Dynamic Linking: In dynamic linking, the library code is not copied into the executable.
//   Instead, the program contains references to the shared libraries, which are loaded at runtime.
