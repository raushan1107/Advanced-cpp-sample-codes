// Output Explanation:
// In the first case, when we delete the Base class pointer pointing to a Derived class object
// without a virtual destructor, only the Base class destructor is called, leading to potential
// resource leaks if the Derived class allocated resources in its constructor.
// In the second case, with a virtual destructor in the CorrectBase class, both the CorrectDerived
// and CorrectBase destructors are called in the correct order, ensuring proper resource cleanup.

// why virtual destructor is important in C++?
// When a base class has a virtual destructor, it ensures that the destructor of the derived class
// is called when an object of the derived class is deleted through a base class pointer.
// This is crucial for proper resource management and avoiding memory leaks in polymorphic scenarios.
// If the base class destructor is not virtual, deleting a derived class object through a base class pointer
// results in undefined behavior, as the derived class destructor will not be invoked.

// what is memory leak?
// A memory leak occurs when a program allocates memory on the heap but fails to release it
// when it is no longer needed. This can lead to increased memory usage over time,
// potentially exhausting available memory and causing the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.
