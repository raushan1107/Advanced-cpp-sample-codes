Exercise: Account Management System (with STL and Algorithms)
Problem Statement

You are required to design a simple Bank Account Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and C++ Standard Template Library (STL) features.

The system should manage multiple account types, calculate interest dynamically, store them efficiently using STL containers, and handle invalid withdrawals using a custom exception.

Requirements
1. Create a base class Account with the following:

Data members:

int accountNumber

string accountHolderName

double balance

Virtual function:
virtual double calculateInterest() const = 0; — pure virtual, to be overridden.

Member functions:

void deposit(double amount)

void withdraw(double amount) — throws a BankException if withdrawal exceeds balance.

2. Create two derived classes:

SavingsAccount — overrides calculateInterest() to return 6.5% of current balance.

CurrentAccount — overrides calculateInterest() to return 7% of current balance.

3. Implement a custom exception class:

class BankException : public std::exception

Constructor accepts an error message.

Override what() to display the error.

Thrown when withdrawal amount > balance.

4. Use STL Containers and Algorithms:

Store multiple accounts in a std::vector<Account*> container.

Use std::for_each() or range-based for loops to:

Display account information.

Calculate and print total interest across all accounts.

Use std::sort() to sort accounts by balance (descending).

Use std::find_if() to search for an account by name or account number.

5. In the main() function:

Create multiple accounts of different types (Savings and Current).

Store them in a std::vector<Account*>.

Demonstrate the following operations:

Calculate and display interest for each account.

Withdraw valid and invalid amounts (handle exception).

Sort and display accounts by balance.

Find a specific account by holder name and display details.
