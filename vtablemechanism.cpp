// What is Vtable Mechanism in C++?
// Vtable (Virtual Table) is a mechanism used in C++ to support dynamic (runtime) polymorphism.
// It is essentially a table of function pointers maintained per class that has virtual functions.

// what is difference between pointer variable and reference variable in C++?
// A pointer variable holds the memory address of another variable and can be reassigned to point to different variables.
// A reference variable is an alias for another variable and cannot be changed to refer to a different variable after its initialization.

// Base b vs Base* bptr
// Base b; // 'b' is an object of type Base, allocated on the stack
// Base* bptr = new Base(); // 'bptr' is a pointer to a Base object, allocated on the heap
// delete bptr; // Free the memory allocated for the Base object
// bptr = nullptr; // Avoid dangling pointer
// In summary, 'b' is a direct instance of Base, while 'bptr' is a pointer that can reference a Base object.

// Is this possible Base b = new Derived();?
// No, this is not possible. 'new Derived()' returns a pointer to a Derived object, while 'Base b' expects an object of type Base. You would need to use a pointer or reference to achieve polymorphism, like so: Base* bptr = new Derived();
