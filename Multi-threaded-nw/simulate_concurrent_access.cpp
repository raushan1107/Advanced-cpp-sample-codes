std::mutex rr_mtx; // protects std::cout. Explanation: multiple threads writing to cout can mix up output.
// what is rr_mtx here?
// rr_mtx is a mutex (mutual exclusion) object that is used to synchronize access
// to the standard output stream (std::cout) in a multi-threaded environment.
// It ensures that only one thread can write to std::cout at a time, preventing interleaved or corrupted output.
// Why do we need mutex for cout?
// In a multi-threaded program, multiple threads may attempt to write to std::cout simultaneously
// without synchronization. This can lead to mixed-up or garbled output, making it difficult
// to read and understand the printed messages. By using a mutex to protect std::cout, we
// ensure that only one thread can write to it at a time. This prevents interleaved output and maintains the integrity
// of the printed messages.
